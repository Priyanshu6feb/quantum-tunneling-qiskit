# Quantum Tunneling Simulation Using Qiskit

This repository contains a simple simulation of quantum tunneling behavior using Qiskit. The project demonstrates the use of quantum circuits to model probabilistic outcomes, akin to a quantum particle interacting with a potential barrier.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project uses a single-qubit quantum circuit to:
- Create superposition using a Hadamard gate
- Simulate a quantum measurement as an analogy to tunneling
- Visualize results using Qiskit's histogram plot

Though simplified, the model provides intuitive insights into quantum mechanics principles like superposition and probabilistic collapse.

## 📁 Files Included
- `quantum_project.py` — Qiskit code to run the simulation
- `project_summary.txt` — Written summary for applications or resumes

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install Qiskit:
```bash
pip install qiskit matplotlib
```
2. Run the Python script:
```bash
python quantum_project.py
```
3. View the histogram output and review the summary file.
