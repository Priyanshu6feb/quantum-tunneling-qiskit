Quantum Tunneling Simulation using Qiskit

This independent project models the basic concept of quantum tunneling using Qiskit's quantum circuits.
A qubit is placed into superposition using a Hadamard gate to simulate a particle with probabilistic behavior.
By measuring the qubit after introducing a potential 'barrier' (modeled by probabilistic collapse), we analogize
the idea of quantum particles 'tunneling' through a classical barrier.

The circuit was simulated with 1000 shots using Qiskit's Aer simulator, and the results demonstrate quantum
probabilities in measurement outcomes. This helped me explore the intersection of physics and computation
while building a deeper intuition for quantum principles like superposition and measurement collapse.
